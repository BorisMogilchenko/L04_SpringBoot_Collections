Implement the generic CustomList class, with the T parameter. This parameter must inherit from the Number base class.  The CustomList class must contain the ArrayList field from T. Implement the add method, which must accept a parameter of type T. When calling the method, the passed parameter must be added  to the previously created ArrayList.   Implement the findMin and findMax methods, whose task is to find and return the smallest and largest element of the ArrayList.  Implement the Main class by creating a main method with the following functionality:  Create an instance of the CustomList class.  In a loop from 0 to 100 elements, generate a random number (class Random) from 0 to 999 at each iteration of the loop.   The resulting number must be added using the add method to the previously created ArrayList.  Display the smallest and largest element of the filled ArrayList.
